# Resonite tty server

Welcome to Runner! the interactive code enviroment brought to you by AutismoPrime!

Runner is a simple, yet powerful tool that allows you to run code in a variety of languages, and see the output in real time. It's perfect for testing out code snippets, or for running scripts.


## Usage
clone the repo and cd into the directory.

run /lib/server.py on a linux system. sorry windows.
spawn out Code from Charlie's public folder inside of a world in resonite and hit the purple button to connect to the server.
once you hear tada.wav, you are connected and can start running code.

type the code inside the main code box or drop one of the demo code files into the import area marked as blue and click the green run button at the top right hand side of the window.
the output will appear in the output window on the left.
# what is this?

ever wondered if you could literly type out text based languages inside of resonite and it just works! well now you can!

code runner is a hardware/server duo that allows you to run python, c, c++ ect within resonite while still including the goodies such as watching cargo run take 24 hours because tokio hung itself for the 20th time today.

code features a fully interactive terminal that allows you to run anything you wish*

runner works through a heavly restricted docker container to run the code directly inside the docker container for safety and proformance*
*just like how you cannot run rm -rf / on a real linux system because you don't have perms regardless of root or not i think?*


i though i might put this here as i'm still in the process of making code iself and some examples for you to try!



:DISCLAMER: 
please know that this can allow arbatrary code execution on your system in the included docker container.
though it is running inside the container, just put caution.
